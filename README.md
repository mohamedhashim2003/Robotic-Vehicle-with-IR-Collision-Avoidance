# Robotic-Vehicle-with-IR-Collision-Avoidance
The project implements a small robotic vehicle that moves forward or backward and stops when an obstacle is detected ahead. An Arduino UNO microcontroller controls the vehicle's movement through programmed commands. An infrared (IR) proximity sensor faces forward to sense obstacles.
